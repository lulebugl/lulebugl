## Hey, I'm Lucas 👋

Developer who likes building but more importantly creating useful things. I trained at [42](https://42.fr), where I spent my time learning by doing and debugging. I found myself enjoying the process more than I thought.

Currently exploring web development, AI and automation.

---

**Tech:** C, C++, TypeScript, React, Next.js, Docker, Linux

---

**Things I've built:**

- [Transcendence](https://github.com/lulebugl/Transcendence) — 3D multiplayer Pong with React, Fastify and SQLite
- [Webserv](https://github.com/lulebugl/webserv) — HTTP/1.1 server from scratch in C++
- [Minishell](https://github.com/lulebugl/minishell) — Bash inspired shell with custom parser
- [cub3D](https://github.com/lulebugl/cub3D) — Wolfenstein-style ray-casting game
